### 2. Implementing Case 1: Data-to-Text Generation with Augmentation Techniques
'''For Case 1, you will need to generate textual summaries from structured data, applying augmentation techniques. This can involve summarizing statistics, insights, and trends from the CSV data.

 Data Augmentation: You can use simple augmentation techniques, such as introducing noise, changing column values, or generating additional features. You can use libraries like `pandas` for this or even basic text-based augmentation methods.

  Text Generation: Use pre-trained models like GPT-2/3 for text generation. To stay within free options, you can use **Hugging Face's transformers** library.

  pip install transformers
  
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 for text generation
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Example function to generate text from the data

from PIL import Image

# Function to extract text from charts/graphs

    return text

# Example use case when an image is uploaded
if uploaded_image is not None:
    extracted_text = extract_text_from_image(image)
    st.write("Extracted Insights from Image:", extracted_text)
def generate_planned_summary(df):
    # Simulate planning logic here (this is a simplified version)
    plan = "First, we need to summarize the dataset structure, then the statistics, and finally the insights."
    summary = f"Dataset Overview: {df.describe()}."
    return plan + " " + summary
